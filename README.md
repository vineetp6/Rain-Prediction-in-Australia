# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

#Introduction
Global warming affects the ecosystem and the human communities across the globe are losing
natural resources and cultural significance. Australia is one of the worst-hit countries that is
experiencing high temperatures, rising sea levels, coral bleaching in The Great Barrier Reef and
unseasonal rain. One such example is the “Black Summer” bushfire in 2019 where more than 55
million acres of land were burnt. However, food security is a major issue caused by climate
change. Agriculture largely depends on rain and hence its forecast becomes imperative. This
project mainly focuses on the prediction of rain the next day. Rain tomorrow is the target variable
of the data. Multiple attributes like Temperature, Windspeed, Humidity, and Pressure are
considered to predict the rain on the next day. The information in the dataset is gathered from
automated equipment from various weather stations. The goal of the project is to build an
efficient classification model which would help in building budget-wise rainfall forecast
applications.
